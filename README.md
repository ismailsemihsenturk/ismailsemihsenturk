<h2><b>Welcome</b></h2>

Backend Developer & AI Engineer focused on building robust systems and implementing AI models from the ground up.

### Core Areas of Expertise:

*   **ü§ñ AI Engineering:**
    *   Deep Learning model implementation (Specializing in Large Language Models and Vision Models).
    *   Proficient in implementing core components like tokenizers (BPE), attention mechanisms, RoPE, KV Caching from scratch.
    *   Experienced in building LLM-powered applications using frameworks like LangChain.
    *   Familiar with vector databases (e.g., Faiss) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search.
    *   Skilled in optimizing LLM fine-tuning (e.g., using libraries like Unsloth).
    *   Experience with running and managing models locally (e.g., using tools like Ollama).
    *   Core Frameworks: Primarily PyTorch.

*   **‚öôÔ∏è Backend & System Development:**
    *   Designing and building scalable APIs and services (Experienced with .NET Core).
    *   Database design and management (SQL Server, NoSQL).
    *   Developing complex business logic and backend systems.
    *   Experience integrating frontend components (React) to build full-stack solutions when needed.

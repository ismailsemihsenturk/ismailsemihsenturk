<h2><b>Welcome</b></h2>

Backend Developer & AI Engineer focused on building robust systems and implementing AI models from the ground up.

### Core Areas of Expertise:

*   **ü§ñ AI Engineering:**
    *   Deep Learning model implementation (Specializing in Large Language Models and Vision Models).
    *   Experienced in implementing core components like tokenizers (BPE), Encoders, Attention mechanisms, RoPE, KV Caching from scratch.
    *   Experienced in building LLM-powered applications using frameworks like LangChain.
    *   Familiar with vector databases (e.g., Faiss) for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and semantic search.
    *   Skilled in optimizing LLM fine-tuning (e.g., using libraries like Unsloth).
    *   Experience with running and managing models locally (e.g., using tools like Ollama).
    *   Core Frameworks: Primarily PyTorch.

*   **‚öôÔ∏è Backend & System Development:**
    *   Designing and building scalable APIs and services (Experienced with .NET Core).
    *   Database design and management (SQL Server, NoSQL).
    *   Developing complex business logic and backend systems.
    *   Experience integrating frontend components (React) to build full-stack solutions when needed.

### Key Projects:

*   **Lastik** This project tackles one of the most famous problems in theoretical computer science‚Äîthe optimization of matrix multiplication‚Äîwith a completely new and intuitive approach. Building upon Strassen's revolutionary 1969 algorithm, which first broke the O(n¬≥) complexity barrier, this project aims to translate its algebraic steps into a visual and geometric                 language. At the heart of this endeavor is a unique visual notation I call "Lastik" (Turkish for "elastic" or "rubber band"), designed to represent matrices and their operations. This notation is mathematically rooted in the rich and elegant geometry of Lissajous curves.
*   **LLAMA 3 Implementation** Built a functional LLAMA 3 model implementation, including BPE tokenizer, RoPE, KV Caching, Grouped Query Attention, and feedforward layers.
*   **Stable Diffusion Implementation:** Implemented Stable Diffusion architecture for text-to-image and image-to-image generation.
*   **PaliGemma VLM Implementation:** Implemented PaliGemma VLM architecture, handling visual encoding and text prompting integration.
*   **GPT-2 Implementation:** Built a GPT-2 architecture implementation for exploring generative text capabilities.
*   **EcoTrack:** React Native Eco FootPrint calculation app.
